in pr3 3rd:
Let’s go through each statement one by one:

a. R2 ← M[AR]
This operation means that the content of the memory location specified by the address in the Address Register (AR) is being transferred to Register 2 (R2).

M[AR] refers to the memory location at the address stored in AR.
R2 ← means that the value fetched from that memory location is loaded into Register 2.
So, in simpler terms, the value in memory at the address stored in AR is read and placed into R2.

b. M[AR] ← R3
In this case, the value in Register 3 (R3) is being written to the memory location specified by the Address Register (AR).

M[AR] refers to the memory location at the address stored in AR.
R3 → means that the value in Register 3 is written to the memory location.
So, this operation means you are storing the value of R3 into the memory location specified by the address in AR.

c. R5 ← M[R5]
This operation involves reading from memory and updating the value of Register 5 (R5).

M[R5] refers to the memory location whose address is currently stored in Register 5.
R5 ← means that the value at that memory location is loaded back into Register 5.
In simpler terms, you are accessing the memory location specified by the address in R5 and then placing the value from that memory location back into Register 5. This could be a form of dereferencing if we think of R5 as a pointer.
